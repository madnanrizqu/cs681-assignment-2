- Use pretrained embeddings (DONE)

For each dataset:
    For each embedding method:
        - Change to use ANN with tensorflow
            + input layers (DONE)
            + hidden layer with Relu (DONE)
            + output with sigmoid (DONE)
            + use binary cross entropy (DONE)
            + init weights with appropriate method (DONE)
            + compare with/without early stopping (DONE)
            + compare with/without dropout (DONE)
            + compare with/without regularization (DONE)
            + compare with/without batch normalization (DONE)
        - evaluation
            + collect accuracy, precision, recall and F1 Score (DONE)
            + visualize using confusion matrices and plots (DONE)

<!-- will be started on writing the report -->
- compare results of different embeddings methods. reason why some perform better
